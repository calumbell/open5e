You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Second Wind \n \nYou have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. \n \n### Action Surge \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. \n \n### Martial Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \nThe number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. \n \n### Indomitable \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n \nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\n \n### Martial Archetypes \n \nDifferent fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.",

These chaplains typically come from religious sects whose tenets promote war, healing, peace, protection, or freedom, and they tend to the emotional and physical well-being of their charges. In the eyes of your companions, you are as much a counselor and spiritual leader as you are a fellow warrior.\n\n##### Student of Faith\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Medicine, or Religion skill (your choice).\n\n##### Field Medic\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use an action to spend one of your Hit Dice and regain hit points. The hit points regained with this feature can be applied to yourself or to another creature you touch. Alternatively, you can heal another creature you touch when you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest, instead of applying the regained hit points to yourself. If you are under an effect that increases the amount of healing you receive when spending Hit Dice, such as a spell or feat, that effect applies to the amount of hit points the target regains. Keep in mind, some effects that increase the healing of Hit Dice happen only when those Hit Dice are spent during a short rest, like a bard's Song of Rest.\n  In addition, the number of Hit Dice you regain after a long rest is equal to half your total number of Hit Dice plus one. For example, if you have four Hit Dice, you regain three spent Hit Dice, instead of two, when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Rally the Troops\nStarting at 7th level, you can use an action to urge your companions to overcome emotional and spiritual obstacles. Each friendly creature of your choice that can see or hear you (which can include yourself) ignores the effects of being charmed and frightened for 1 minute.\n  If a creature affected by this feature is already suffering from one of the conditions it can ignore, that condition is suppressed for the duration and resumes when this feature ends. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n  Each target can ignore additional conditions when you reach certain levels in this class: one level of exhaustion and incapacitated at 10th level, up to two levels of exhaustion and stunned at 15th level, and up to three levels of exhaustion and paralyzed at 17th level.\n\n##### Tend the Injured\nAt 10th level, if you spend Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest, any hit points regained that exceed your hit point maximum, or that of the creature being tended to, can be applied to another creature within 5 feet of you. In addition, you regain one spent Hit Die when you finish a short rest.\n\n##### Rally Point\nBeginning at 15th level, when a friendly creature you can see takes damage, you can use your reaction to move that creature up to its speed toward you. The creature can choose the path traveled, but it must end the movement closer to you than it started. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Hospitaler\nAt 18th level, you recover a number of spent Hit Dice equal to a quarter of your total Hit Dice when you finish a short rest. In addition, you recover all your spent Hit Dice when you finish a long rest.",

This style of fighting spread far and wide, finding an honored place among the armies and mercenary companies of other races. True legionaries scoff at the image of the storybook hero standing alone against impossible odds, knowing together they can face any danger and emerge victorious.\nBonus Proficiency\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Nature, or Survival skill (your choice).\n\n##### Coordinated Fighting\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn techniques and strategies for close-quarter combat. On your first attack each round, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls if at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you.\n\n##### Move As One\nAt 3rd level, at any point while moving on your turn, you can command a number of willing, friendly creatures within 5 feet of you up to your proficiency bonus to move with you. Each creature that chooses to move with you can use a reaction to move up to its speed alongside you, remaining within 5 feet of you while moving. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Massed Fighting\nStarting at 7th level, you learn better techniques and strategies for fighting closely alongside your allies. On your first attack each round, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls for each friendly creature within 5 feet of you, up to a maximum bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.\n  In addition, when you use your Action Surge feature, each friendly creature within 15 feet of you (except you) gains a +2 bonus to AC and to Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute.\n\n##### Vigilance\nAt 10th level, when a friendly creature you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward it. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n##### Tactical Positioning\nAt 15th level, moving through a hostile creature's space is not difficult terrain for you, and you can move through a hostile creature's space even if it is only one size larger or smaller than you. As normal, you can't end your move in a hostile creature's space.\n\n##### Cooperative Strike\nStarting at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon while at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to make one additional attack with that weapon.",

Whether in fighting pits by the docks to make some extra coin, in the king's grand arena as champions of quarreling nobles, or in the employ of local merchants in need of seemingly weaponless guards, pugilists can be found in all rungs of society. Pugilists take pleasure in a battle hard won and thrill in the energy of the fight rather than in a kill. They can often be found celebrating or having drinks with a former opponent hours after the fight, regardless of the bout's winner.\n\n##### Unarmed Warrior\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your fists, knees, elbows, head, and feet to attack your opponents. You gain the following benefits while you are not wearing heavy armor and while you are not wielding weapons or a shield: \n* Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. Your unarmed strike damage increases as you reach higher levels. The d6 becomes a d8 at 10th level and a d10 at 18th level. \n* When you use the Attack action to make one or more unarmed strikes, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.\n\n##### Resilient Fighter\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn to endure great amounts of physical punishment. You add your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) to any death saving throw you make. In addition, you can use Second Wind a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Uncanny Fortitude\nBeginning at 7th level, if damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, when you use Second Wind, you now regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level + your Constitution modifier.\n\n##### Debilitating Blow\nAt 10th level, when you hit one target with two unarmed strikes in the same turn, you can use a bonus action to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Withstand Death\nAt 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use Second Wind as a reaction, provided you have uses of Second Wind remaining. You can decide to use this reaction before or after your Uncanny Fortitude feature triggers.\n  In addition, when you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as one failure instead of two.\n\n##### Opportunistic Brawler\nStarting at 18th level, you might not look for a fight around every corner, but you're ready in case one happens. You have advantage on initiative rolls.\n  In addition, when a creature you can see enters a space within 5 feet of you, you can make one opportunity attack against the creature. This opportunity attack must be made with an unarmed strike. You have a number of reactions each turn equal to your proficiency bonus, but these reactions can be used only to perform opportunity attacks.",

To use this feature, you must be wielding a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear.\n\n##### Radiant Fighting\nStarting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear, you can choose for the damage to be radiant instead of its normal damage type.\n\n##### Formation Tactics\nAt 7th level, you bolster your allies when fighting shoulder to shoulder. While you have an ally within 5 feet of you who isn't incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to take the Help action to assist that ally's attack roll or their next Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.\n\n##### Foe of Darkness\nBeginning at 10th level, your faith and training make you a daunting foe of dark creatures. Once per turn, you can have advantage on an attack roll or ability check made against a fiend, undead, or creature of shadow.\n\n##### Give Ground\nStarting at 15th level, once per turn when you are hit by a melee attack, you can choose to move 5 feet away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks. If you do, the attacker takes 1d6 radiant damage. To use this feature, you must be wielding a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear.\n\n##### The Sun's Protection\nAt 18th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. At 10th level, you can move up to 30 feet. \n* **Dislocative Shove.** You push the target of your attack to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. You can move the target only horizontally, and before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), ending the movement in an unoccupied space next to the damaging terrain on a success. At 10th level, you can move the target up to 30 feet.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Chronologic Echo\nAt 7th level, immediately after you use your Second Wind feature, you can trigger an echo in time, allowing you to use it twice. Roll separately for each use of Second Wind. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Improved Temporal Strike\nAt 10th level, when you use your Temporal Strike feature, you can choose one of the following additional options: \n* **Chronal Cleave.** You immediately make a weapon attack against a different target within range. \n* **Chronal Shield.** You add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n##### Continuity Rift\nAt 15th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can instantly open a rupture in spacetime to swallow the target. The creature disappears and falls through a realm outside of reality.\n  At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. It takes 8d8 psychic damage as it grapples with the mind-breaking experience. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or it acts randomly for 1 minute as if under the effects of the *confusion* spell. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Temporal Warrior\nStarting at 18th level, you can momentarily step outside of time to attack your foes. As an action, you can briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This effect works like the *time stop* spell, except you can make one attack on each of your turns without ending the effect. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

While the techniques of the tunnel watchers originated with the dwarves, others see the value in such specialization. Tunnel watchers can thus be found throughout the mountainous regions of the world.\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nAt 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools and mason's tools.\n\n##### First Line of Defense\nStarting at 3rd level, a creature that you hit with a melee weapon attack has its speed reduced by 5 feet and can't use the Disengage action until the start of your next turn. You can't reduce a creature's speed by more than 10 feet with this feature.\n  In addition, when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type.\n\n##### Fight for Every Step\nAt 3rd level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet away from the attacker, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 1d6 + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the space you left. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n  The attacker can immediately move into the space you left. This movement doesn't cost the attacker's reaction and doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, but a creature can move this way only once each turn.\n\n##### Safe Passage\nStarting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against traps, natural hazards, and lair actions. Traps, natural hazards, and lair actions have disadvantage when they make attack rolls against you.\n\n##### Steadfast\nAt 10th level, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition and effects that would move you against your will, including teleportation effects. When a hostile creature forces you to make a Strength saving throw and you succeed, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type the next time you hit with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn.\n\n##### Cave-In\nStarting at 15th level, once on each of your turns when you use the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with a strike against a wall or ceiling within your weapon's reach or range. Creatures other than you within 5 feet of the section of wall or the floor below the ceiling where you strike must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).\n  A creature that fails this saving throw takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half the damage and isn't restrained. While restrained in this way, a creature has three-quarters cover against creatures other than you. When the effect ends, the creature's space becomes difficult terrain.\n\n##### Against the Tide\nBeginning at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and hit more than one creature with a weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. When you shove more than one creature on your turn, you can use a bonus action to shove one creature within 5 feet of a creature you successfully shoved.",

          desc: 'Most fighters train exhaustively with their preferred weapons to hone their power and reflexes. To some, this easily flows into the careful practice of magic as well. Unlike wizards, arcane warriors focus on a smaller number of spells that they commit to memory, particularly from the schools of magic that focus on protection and direct damage which are particularly useful in a combat setting. An arcane warrior can be a jack of all trades, solving problems with force or magic as the situation warrants. They can also aim to master a few strategies that use their martial and mental aptitude in equal measure.\n\n##### Spellcasting\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can cast spells from the wizard spell list.\n\n**_Cantrips._** Choose two cantrips from the wizard spell list to learn. At 10th level, you learn one additional cantrip from the same list.\n\n**_Spell Slots._** You use spell slots to cast 1st level and higher spells, expending a spell slot equal to or higher than the level of the spell you wish to cast. When you complete a long rest, you regain any spell slots you have used. The number of spell slots of different levels available are shown on the Arcane Warrior Spells table.\nFor example, if you are a 7th-level Arcane Warrior who knows the 1st-level spell _magic missile_, you could use any of your unused 1st or 2nd-level spell slots to cast the spell. However, if you wanted to cast 2nd-level spell _shatter_, you would need to expend a 2nd-level spell slot in order to cast it.\n\n**_1st-Level and Higher Spells Known._** Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you learn three 1st-level spells from the wizard spell list. At least two of these spells must be from the abjuration or evocation schools.\n\nYou automatically learn additional spells from the wizard spell list as you gain levels, as shown on the Arcane Warrior Spells table. When you learn a new spell, it must be of a level that you can cast with your existing spell slots. Initially, you must choose your new spells from the evocation and abjuration schools, but starting at 8th level, you can choose from any type of spell on the wizard spell list.\n\nFor instance, upon reaching 7th level in this class, an Arcane Warrior could learn a new spell of either 1st or 2nd-level, but it must be from either the abjuration or evocation schools. At 8th level, the Arcane Warrior learns another spell of 1st or 2nd-level, which can be chosen from any spell school.\n\nEvery time you gain a new level of Arcane Warrior, you have the choice to replace one of your known wizard spells with a different spell from the same list of a level for which you have spell slots. However, if your Arcane Warrior level is 7th or lower, you can only know one spell of 1st level or higher from a school other than abjuration or evocation. At 8th level or higher in this class, you can learn additional spells from other schools, but at least 4 of your known spells of 1st level or higher must be from these two schools.\n\n**_Spellcasting Ability._** You use rote memorization and diligent study to master your wizard spells, so your spellcasting ability for these is Intelligence. You use your Intelligence modifier when making a spell attack roll with a wizard spell, as well as to calculate the DC of a saving throw against one of your wizard spells. If the text of a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, use your Intelligence.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n**Arcane Warrior Spells (table)**\n\n| Fighter Level | Known Cantrips | Known Spells | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |\n|---------------|----------------|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 3rd           | 2              | 3            | 2   | -   | -   | -   |\n| 4th           | 2              | 4            | 3   | -   | -   | -   |\n| 5th           | 2              | 4            | 3   | -   | -   | -   |\n| 6th           | 2              | 4            | 3   | -   | -   | -   |\n| 7th           | 2              | 5            | 4   | 2   | -   | -   |\n| 8th           | 2              | 6            | 4   | 2   | -   | -   |\n| 9th           | 2              | 6            | 4   | 2   | -   | -   |\n| 10th          | 3              | 7            | 4   | 3   | -   | -   |\n| 11th          | 3              | 8            | 4   | 3   | -   | -   |\n| 12th          | 3              | 8            | 4   | 3   | -   | -   |\n| 13th          | 3              | 9            | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   |\n| 14th          | 3              | 10           | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   |\n| 15th          | 3              | 10           | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   |\n| 16th          | 3              | 11           | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   |\n| 17th          | 3              | 11           | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   |\n| 18th          | 3              | 11           | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   |\n| 19th          | 3              | 12           | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   |\n| 20th          | 3              | 13           | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   |\n\n##### Bonded Weapon\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you can create a magical bond between you and a particular weapon of your choice. This weapon becomes almost like a part of you, and unless you are incapacitated, no one can disarm it from you. If you are not holding the weapon, you can use a bonus action to summon it instantly into your hand via teleportation unless it is on another plane of existence.\n\nTo create the magical bond with your weapon, you must perform a ritual that takes 1 hour. During the ritual, the weapon you are attempting to bond with must always be at your side, but you can otherwise complete the ritual over the course of a short rest. You can perform the ritual multiple times, but you can only remain bonded to two particular weapons at any given time. Bonding with a third weapon will break the bond with one of your other weapons that you choose. Furthermore, you can only use your bonus action to summon one bonded weapon per turn.\n\n##### Battle Magic\n\nAt 7th level, you can use your bonus action to make a weapon attack on a turn that you use an action to cast a cantrip.\n\n##### Arcane Strike\n\nStarting at 10th level, foes you strike in combat become more susceptible to your magical offensives as well. Creatures suffer disadvantage on a saving throw against your spells if you have hit them with a weapon attack. This effect only lasts until the end of your next turn after hitting the creature, and only applies to the first saving throw they make against one of your spells during this time.\n\n##### Eldritch Charge\n\nStarting at 15th level, your ferocious charges let you briefly plunge through the ethereal plane. When you use an Action Surge, in addition to gaining an additional action, you can teleport to any unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet. This teleportation and your extra action can be used in either order.\n\n##### Improved Battle Magic\n\nAt 18th level, your ability to use spells in combat further improves. You can use your bonus action to make an attack after using your action to cast a spell of any level, not just cantrips.',

          desc: "The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. \n \n##### Improved Critical \n \nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. \n \n##### Remarkable Athlete \n \nStarting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus. \n \nIn addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. \n \n##### Additional Fighting Style \n \nAt 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature. \n \n##### Superior Critical \n \nStarting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. \n \n##### Survivor \n \nAt 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.",
